# PowerMon
Small UI to monitor power levels of entities

## Need
Every time we have power issues it would be cool to see the current energy level of an accumulator stack or of any electrical network.

Usually you have to run to a power pole and then read the graphs.
This is awesome, but much more info than needed.

## Solution
This mod shows you the current energy level of an entity compared to the maximum that was ever recorded.

You can monitor multiple entities at the same time and give them names to distinguish them.
